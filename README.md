[![Tests](https://github.com/speakeasy-api/openapi-generation-tests/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/speakeasy-api/openapi-generation-tests/actions/workflows/test.yml)

This repo contains the test suites for [Speakeasy's OpenAPI SDK Generator](https://www.speakeasyapi.dev/docs/create-client-sdks). It shows the testing we run internally on SDKs generated from an OpenAPI document that contains a large range of potential API shapes to ensure our generation covers all the use cases we support with our SDKs.
